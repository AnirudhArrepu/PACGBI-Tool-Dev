# PACGBI-Tool-Dev

**PACGBI (Pipeline for Automated COBOL Generation from Backlog Items)** is an AI-powered tool that automates debugging and maintenance of COBOL systems by translating GitHub issues into code-level fixes and documentation.
By integrating graph theory, and large language models (LLMs), PACGBI locates affected COBOL functions, generates patches, creates UML diagrams, and opens ready-to-merge pull requestsâ€”all following a fully automated GitHub-based workflow.

## Features

- **LLM-based Fix Generation** - using Mistral API
- **Graph-based Code Analysis** - for function relevance scoring
- **GitHub Issue Integration** - using the REST API
- **UML Diagram Generation** - for legacy code visualization
- **Automatic Pull Requests** - with commit-ready patches
- **GitHub CLI Extension** -  to easily run the tool from your terminal
