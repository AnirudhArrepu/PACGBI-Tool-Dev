# **1. Optimize Supplier Lookup (305-SEARCH-SUPPLIER-RECORD)**
## Current Issue:

The supplier lookup searches linearly (O(n) complexity), checking each record one by one until it finds a match.
If there are many suppliers (e.g., 1000+ records), the search slows down significantly.
# **2. Improve File Handling (OPEN, READ, WRITE)**
## Current Issue:

The program opens all files at once in 301-OPEN-FILES, even if some are never used.
Some files are opened but not checked for errors.
# **3. Reduce Repeated Calculations (307-CALCULATE-TOTAL-VALUE)**
## Current Issue:

The total inventory value is updated every time a record is processed (ADD INVENTORY-VALUE TO TOTAL-VALUE).
This calculation runs for every item, even if not needed.
# **4. Improve String Formatting for Reports**
## Current Issue:

The report output has hardcoded spaces and manual formatting, making it difficult to maintain.
